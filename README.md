# NBA Player Value Index – PER per $M Spent 💸🏀

This project uses a simple, insightful metric to evaluate NBA player efficiency relative to their salary.

## 📊 What is the Value Index?

**Value Index = PER ÷ Salary (in millions)**

It estimates how much production a player delivers per $1 million spent — making it easier to compare contracts and uncover undervalued talent.
